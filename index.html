<p>The developers of BitShares formed Cryptonomex to monetize the technology, experience, reputation and good will they accumulated during their first two years of development and operations. Much of that technology is embodied in Graphene™, an industrial strength software platform for deploying third generation cryptographically secure decentralized ledgers known as block chains.</p>
<p>Graphene based systems have orders of magnitude better performance than first-generation Bitcoin-derived systems or even the second generation “Bitcoin 2.0” systems that constitute our current closest competitors. Graphene based systems go beyond mere “checkbook” style payments to offer a broad range of financial services distinguished by their transparency and inherent incorruptibility.</p>
<p>This page documents the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/cryptonomex/graphene">Graphene</a> technology built by <a class="reference external" href="http://cryptonomex.com">Cryptonomex</a>. You can see Graphene as a toolkit for real-time blockchains. We separated the documentation into smaller parts for convenience and for the sake of easy location of relevant information.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">BitShares 2.0</a><a class="headerlink" href="#bitshares-2-0" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>BitShares is a technology supported by next generation entrepreneurs, investors, and developers with a common interest in finding free market solutions by leveraging the power of globally decentralized consensus and decision making. Consensus technology has the power to do for economics what the internet did for information. It can harness the combined power of all humanity to coordinate the discovery and aggregation of real-time knowledge, previously unobtainable. This knowledge can be used to more effectively
coordinate the allocation of resources toward their most productive and valuable use.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is the first fully autonomous system to utilize distributed consensus technology to create a more efficient and reliable global payment network. The core innovation of Bitcoin is the Blockchain, a cryptographically secured public ledger of all accounts on the Bitcoin network that facilitates the transfer of value from one individual directly to another. For the first time in history, financial transactions over the internet no longer require a middle man to act as a trustworthy, confidential fiduciary.</p>
<p>BitShares looks to extend the innovation of the blockchain to all industries that rely upon the internet to provide their services.  Whether its banking, stock exchanges, lotteries, voting, music, auctions or many others, a digital public ledger allows for the creation of distributed autonomous companies (or DACs) that provide better quality services at a fraction of the cost incurred by their more traditional, centralized counterparts. The advent of DACs ushers in a new paradigm in organizational structure in
which companies can run without any human management and under the control of an incorruptible set of business rules. These rules are encoded in publicly auditable open source software distributed across the computers of the companies’ shareholders, who effortlessly secure the company from arbitrary control.</p>
<p>BitShares does for business what bitcoin did for money by utilizing distributed consensus technology to create companies that are inherently global, transparent, trustworthy, efficient and most importantly profitable.</p>
<p>BitShares has went through many changes and has done its best to stay on top of blockchain technology. Towards the end of 2014 some of the DACs were merged and the X was dropped from “BitShares X” to become simply BitShares (BTS).</p>

<p>BitShares X was first introduced in a White Paper titled “A Peer-to-Peer Polymorphic Digital Asset Exchange” by Daniel Larimer, Charles Hoskinson, and Stan Larimer. Shortly after authoring the White Paper, the project was founded by Daniel Larimer of Invictus Innovations after receiving funding from Chinese venture capital firm BitFund.PE. Charles Hoskinson, founder of the Bitcoin Education Project, was a co-founder of the original project but has since left the team. The BitShares X project received a lot of attention in August 2013 when it was covered by CoinDesk and subsequently announced to the the BitcoinTalk forums on August 22nd 2013 as a project announcement. The project generated a good amount of buzz around the proposal, though the original scope and timelines have since modified.</p>

<p>Consensus is the mechanism by which organizations of people decide upon unitary rational action. While not considered technology in the traditional since, consensus “technology” is the basis of democratic governance and the coordination of free market activity first coined by Adam Smith as the “Invisible Hand.” The process of consensus decision-making allows for all participants to consent upon a resolution of action even if not the favored course of action for each individual participant. Bitcoin was the first system to integrate a fully decentralized consensus method with the modern technology of the internet and peer-to-peer networks in order to more efficiently facilitate the transfer of value through electronic communication. The proof-of-work structure that secures and maintains the Bitcoin network is one manner of organizing individuals who do not necessarily trust one another to act in the best interest of all participants of the network.  The BitShares ecosystem employs Delegated Proof of Stake in order to find efficient solutions to distributed consensus decision making.</p>

<p>Distributed Autonomous Companies (DAC) run without any human involvement under the control of an incorruptible set of business rules. (That’s why they must be distributed and autonomous.) These rules are implemented as publicly auditable open source software distributed across the computers of their stakeholders. You become a stakeholder by buying “stock” in the company or being paid in that stock to provide services for the company. This stock may entitle you to a share of its “profits”, participation in its growth, and/or a say in how it is run.</p>

<p>On the second day of June 2013 is the anniversary of the invention of BitShares. That day, a rogue entrepreneur named Dan “Bytemaster” Larimer was struck on the head by a proverbial migrating coconut. When he regained consciousness, he realized that he had invented bit-USD, the key insight that makes BitShares possible. Before sundown he had reworked his original BitShares whitepaper and published the whole new concept at bitcointalk.org:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=223747.0">Creating a Fiat/Bitcoin Exchange without Fiat Deposits</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Over the next five weeks, Bytemaster engaged in a series of vigorous forum discussions defending and refining the concept. There he met Charles Hoskinson who helped to vet the idea and develop a business plan. Charles presented the plan to Li Xiaolai in China who agreed to fund the development. On American Independence Day, the Fourth of July 2013, Invictus Innovations was incorporated in the state of Virginia.</p>
<p>The next several months were spent bootstrapping the company and publishing articles, many of which may be found on the bitsharestalk.org thread at <a class="reference external" href="https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=889.msg8935#msg8935">Advice, Tutorials, and General References for Newbies.</a></p>
<p>In September, the concept of a Distributed Autonomous Company (DAC) was invented and introduced to the world in two groundbreaking LetsTalkBitcoin.com articles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://letstalkbitcoin.com/is-bitcoin-overpaying-for-false-security/#.Ui-p9WTFT7s">Overpaying for Security</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://letstalkbitcoin.com/bitcoin-and-the-three-laws-of-robotics/">Bitcoin and the Three Laws of Robotics</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Invictus introduced the BitShares Vision to the world via presentations by Hoskinson and Larimer at the Atlanta Bitcoin Conference in October 2013. It is here that the plans for Keyhotee were first introduced – an integrated multi-wallet, communication, and DAC interface application intended to defend privacy and help spread knowledge of BitShares technologies outside the crypto-currency community.</p>
<p>Hoskinson and Larimer parted company at this point. They each agreed to keep their reasons confidential and there is no bad blood from our point of view. The only official statement on the subject was made by CEO Bo Shen to end a minor forum firestorm here:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=2188.msg32672#msg32672">BitSharestalk</a></p>
<p>It is our opinion that Charles Hoskinson is the best dealmaker we have ever seen, and we miss his vision and talent for recruiting allies. No doubt he will help make his new Ethereum team very successful.</p>
<p>Despite this loss, all of this activity was beginning to create a buzz that would soon explode on the scene with a sequence of revolutionary innovations at roughly monthly intervals that continue to this very day.</p>
<p>The first was ProtoShares…</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="part-two">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Part Two</a><a class="headerlink" href="#part-two" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>November’s Innovation – BitShares PTS</p>
<p>BitShares PTS (formerly called ProtoShares) was developed for an entirely different reason than what its paradigm-shattering role became shortly after launch. In fact, every one of the subsequent breathtaking innovations came about from reacting to opportunities and lessons learned from the previous month’s breakthroughs and, um, screw-ups. Necessity is the mother of invention. I wish we could say we had it all planned out in advance, but no business plan survives first contact with the market. We are merely blessed opportunists.</p>
<p>Initially, we were just looking for a way serve people interested in our first objective, BitShares X. A way for them to start mining and trading it early. BitShares X was first viewed as a coin backed by a built-in business that gives it more worth than the speculative value of a meme or some alternative technical implementation. In this first case, that integral unmanned business was a decentralized bank and exchange.</p>
<p>Yep. Your coins would now contain a bank, not the other way around.</p>
<p>Needless to say, this kind of second-generation crypto-company takes a lot longer to build and early adopters were growing impatient. So our plan was to just offer a plain old Bitcoin clone whose coins would be a BitShares X prototype - upgradable into BitShares X “bitshares” when it was ready to launch. We would simply initialize the first 10% of the bitshares to match all the public keys of PTS holders, giving them instant matching control of the same number of bitshares in BitShares X. This is how the concept of a protocoin was born.</p>
<p>We envisioned many exciting uses for protocoins. For example, they could be used as A way to separate investing in an idea from investing in one or more implementations of the idea. An incentive for competitors to cooperate on building an implementation because they could all be common stakeholders in the idea. A way to vet an idea and attract venture capitalists based upon prediction market evidence that the idea has value. A way for developers to invest in an idea and raise funding by generating growth from showing more and more evidence that they will successfully implement the idea in a way that benefits investors in the idea. A way for someone with a good idea but lacking the ability to implement it to share it and benefit from its ultimate implementation by somebody else. A way for an entire community to participate in “pre-mining” in a way that might be deemed fair (e.g. for unmanned businesses that must start out with enough currency to operate and enough credibility to get market depth on exchanges from Day One.) A more graceful “soft fork” way to upgrade to version two of a DAC by instantiating the new in parallel with the old and let the owners (shareholders) not just the employees (miners) decide when and if value transitions from the old to the new. A way to build a community and get them to cooperate on the implementation because they all have a stake in the idea. So you see, right off the bat we are talking about two assets: PTS and BTS. Before long, we would be talking about entire families of such assets. Second-generation crypto-currencies that we began to call crypto-equities because the coins also seemed like “shares” in the underlying unmanned business that gave the currency value - BitShares.</p>
<p>Since then, we have come to prefer the inverse of this dual metaphor:</p>
<p>Bitcoin is a type of crypto-company that implements a coin not BitShares as a type of crypto-coin that implements a company.</p>
<p>Of course, BitShares are something very different than shares in a government-created and therefore government-regulated organization. We are speaking metaphorically to help people understand how they work and what gives them value. They can still be viewed as ordinary altcoins (ok, incredibly powerful ordinary altcoins) as far as their underlying technology is concerned.</p>
<p>Charles Evans explored this dual metaphor in this delightful blog article:</p>
<p>A BitRose by Any Other Name. <a class="reference external" href="http://bitshares.org/a-bitrose-by-any-other-name/">http://bitshares.org/a-bitrose-by-any-other-name/</a></p>
<p>We offered a bounty for an experienced coin designer to build the PTS protocoin for us. A developer known as FreeTrade answered the call. It took him about a month to clone it from the Bitcoin library. Then, while we were still evaluating his code, another independent entrepreneur known as Super3 downloaded the open-source from FreeTrade’s library and started it running. On November 5, 2013 Super3 went down in history as the miner of the first protocoin block in crypto-equity history!</p>
<p>POW! The rest of the world (who had been eagerly awaiting the launch based on the several months we had been writing about it) jumped on it with everything they had. It took just a few days before the competition became so intense that people had a hard time mining solo with their individual computers. They started joining pools that several enterprising businessmen quickly set up and then everyone started renting cloud computers to remain competitive. By the end of the third week, there were hundreds of thousands of mining nodes competing. Several independent coin exchanges jumped in and listed PTS, driving it immediately into the top ten of the over 100 coins listed on coinmarketcap.com at the time.</p>
<p>So you see, we really don’t own PTS. It was launched by the industry for the industry. We just described what ought to exist, and a decentralized industry of entrepreneurs produced it practically overnight.</p>
<p>Of course, that moon shot may have had something to do with one small suggestion we made literally at the last minute: we decided to recommend PTS be the basis for more than just BitShares X. PTS should also be used to initialize all of the other second-generation assets we had been writing about. Mine once for a whole family of assets. Why should you have to keep mining over and over again to get a “fair” distribution?</p>
<p>In fact, we recommended that other developers do the same thing. Suddenly BitShares PTS was backed by more than thin air. More than just one unmanned business. More than just one company’s product line of unmanned businesses. It could well become backed by a good portion of the unmanned business industry!</p>
<p>BitShares PTS was valuable because as a universal prototype it was upgradable to multiple future releases like BitShares X.</p>
<p>Just like a good deal on Microsoft Office 1.0 might get you free upgrades on Word, Excel, PowerPoint and all the rest …for as long as you both shall live!</p>
<p>To a community willing to speculate on any altcoin with a cute name, that was all it took. Now there was something tangible to speculate on. Soon crypto-currency speculators would be demanding to know every new asset’s business case.</p>
<p>Imagine that! We had almost accidentally changed the crypto-currency industry forever.</p>
<p>It was just our opening shot.</p>

<div class="section" id="part-three">

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">December’s Innovation – TAPOS and the End of Mining</a><a class="headerlink" href="#december-s-innovation-tapos-and-the-end-of-mining" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In the weeks that followed it became increasingly obvious that the whole paradigm of mining on which the crypto-currency industry is founded was horribly flawed. While generally billed as a “fair” lottery for wide distribution of a new currency, it was clear that the ordinary guy was still at a disadvantage. Technically savvy people could use and optimize the tools - others could not install their wallet. Wealthy individuals could rent computers by the thousands - others had no computer at all. Only a very small percentage of the general population was benefiting - sucking up the lion’s share of the coins and then reselling them on the market at a profit.</p>
<p>Now, there’s nothing wrong with using your brains or wealth to earn a profit while contributing to society (like, say, developing a new technology), but as far as the general public was concerned, this small elite group of individuals were effectively just selling the currency into existence. Most of the general population had to buy them from the market anyway!</p>
<p>And even those elite few only got to keep a small percentage of what the market was willing to pay for the currency. They were required to destroy most of what they received from the market doing the electronic equivalent of digging holes and filling them back in. The whole industry was ein bisschen poco loco.</p>
<p>“No, wait!”, the Bitcoin-trained community protested, “burning the seed capital is the price we must pay for securing the network!”</p>
<p>Except the network was not really being secured. Economies of scale dictate that hashing power will always migrate toward specialized capital-intensive organizations ultimately killing the very decentralization that mining was supposed to ensure. Today, most Bitcoin mining power is concentrated in the hands of a half-dozen individuals with just two of them controlling over 51%. And they proudly collaborate “for the good of the network.”</p>
<p>Bytemaster recognized that Bitcoin could be viewed as an unprofitable company and its coins as stock in that company. Stock value was generally rising because demand for its services (efficient private money transmission) exceeded supply. But, meanwhile it was bleeding red ink. 100% of its transaction fees were going to pay its employees (the miners). But that still wasn’t enough. It had to print more money (up to 12% annual inflation) also to pay its employees. So Bitcoin is a company with annual losses near 12%. (And the employees were only getting to keep a few percent of the money being wasted on them.)</p>
<p>He decided that eliminating those employees was a key objective that would inevitably lead to a whole new generation of profitable crypto-businesses. Assets based on destructive mining would go the way of the dinosaur, unable to compete with profitable business models of second generation assets that could afford to pay dividends and interest to their holders. It was just a matter of time.</p>
<p>So a month after the ProtoShares revolution, around December 1, Bytemaster fired his second shot heard round the world: all his future designs would replace Proof of Work mining with a Proof of Stake derivative.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=1138.msg11955#msg11955">Transactions as Proof of Stake (TAPOS) and the End of Mining</a> . An algorithm that was lightweight enough to run invisibly on anyone’s computer, for free! Mining was dead. Next generation crypto-assets would be profitable. They would be valuable because they returned a yield, rather than for superficial speculative reasons.</p>
<p>There were merely a few technical wrinkles to iron out…</p>

<p>Build and launch BitShares X Build a company to Build and launch BitShares X. Build a decentralized industry in which this company could build and launch BitShares X (and many more).</p>
<p>Part of our task was to research the legal requirements to accomplish all of these goals.</p>
<p>In the process of studying the requirements in the United States we ran into a number of issues and uncertainties. In particular, there are strict rules about who can own shares of a U.S. corporation.</p>
<p>We recommended to Mr. Li that he ask an attorney he trusts to start over and create a company that would be able to meet all of the goals and honor all of his commitments. It has taken six months to work out all the details, after consulting with Li’s attorney and multiple U.S law firms.</p>
<p>We will soon be ready to release a public statement about the details, but the bottom line is that Invictus Innovations Incorporated, LTD in Hong Kong is the company we intended to create in Virginia, except with the ability to meet the needs of Asian investors better than we can here.</p>
<p>So, you can think of it as relocating the Virginia company, but legally they are two independent companies with independent management aiming to meet Mr. Li’s goals and obligations 100%.</p>
<p>The Virginia company now only handles small tasks associated with American payroll and payment processing. Further details on this decomposition into independent businesses optimized to comply with all regulations in their domains will be forthcoming.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">The Great Consolidation</a><a class="headerlink" href="#the-great-consolidation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the late part of 2014 it became obvious that Bytemaster had to lend his energies to other projects. People had donated AGS funds with the expectation of future DACs. With the decreasing funding due to dropping BTC prices and the requirements of Dan Larimer, the Great Consolidation occurred. Follow My Vote and DNS were merged into BTS so that all developers could be brought to work directly on one product instead of DACs all competing for users.</p>
<p>One outcome of this was also the addition of paying on the blockchain. Previously BitShares was a purely deflationary blockchain with dividends paid out by the burning of transaction fees. (Less currency in existence gives more value to those remaining.) With a pressing need to be the most innovative crypto-currency out there, it was determined that the Delegates needed to start paying. So the cap on Bitshares was raised to be slowly paid out similar to the inflation in Bitcoin. The rate was made to be kept under the current level of Bitcoin inflation, but delivering direct and meaningful value.

<h2>Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS)<a class="headerlink" href="#delegated-proof-of-stake-dpos" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS) is a new method of securing a crypto-currency’s network.  DPOS attempts to solve the problems of both Bitcoin’s traditional Proof of Work system, and the Proof of Stake system of Peercoin and NXT. DPOS implements a layer of technological democracy to offset the negative effects of centralization.</p>

<p>Delegated proof of stake mitigates the potential negative impacts of centralization through the use of witnesses (formally called <em>delegates</em>). A total of <cite>N</cite> witnesses sign the blocks and are voted on by those using the network with every transaction that gets made. By using a decentralized voting process, DPOS is by design more democratic than comparable systems. Rather than eliminating the need for trust all together, DPOS has safeguards in place the ensure that those trusted with signing blocks on behalf of the network are doing so correctly and without bias. Additionally, each block signed must have a verification that the block before it was signed by a trusted node. DPOS eliminates the need to wait until a certain number of untrusted nodes have verified a transaction before it can be confirmed.</p>
<p>This reduced need for confirmation produces an increase in speed of transaction times. By intentionally placing trust with the most trustworthy of potential block signers, as decided by the network, no artificial encumbrance need be imposed to slow down the block signing process. DPOS allows for many more transactions to be included in a block than either proof of work or proof of stake systems. DPOS technology allows cryptocurrency technology to transact at a level where it can compete with the centralized clearinghouses like Visa and Mastercard. Such clearinghouses administer the most popular forms of electronic payment systems in the world.</p>
<p>In a delegated proof of stake system centralization still occurs, but it is controlled. Unlike other methods of securing cryptocurrency networks, every client in a DPOS system has the ability to decide who is trusted rather than trust concentrating in the hands of those with the most resources. DPOS allows the network to reap some of the major advantages of centralization, while still maintaining some calculated measure of decentralization. This system is enforced by a fair election process where anyone could potentially become a delegated representative of the majority of users.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Rationale Behind DPOS</a><a class="headerlink" href="#rationale-behind-dpos" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Give shareholders a way to delegate their vote to a key (one that doesn’t control coins ‘so they can mine’)</li>
<li>Maximize the dividends shareholders earn</li>
<li>Minimize the amount paid to secure the network</li>
<li>Maximize the performance of the network</li>
<li>Minimize the cost of running the network (bandwidth, CPU, etc)</li>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Shareholders are in Control</a><a class="headerlink" href="#shareholders-are-in-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The fundamental feature of DPOS is that shareholders remain in control. If they remain in control then it is decentralized. As flawed as voting can be, when it comes to shared ownership of a company it is the only viable way. Fortunately if you do not like who is running the company you can sell and this market feedback causes shareholders to vote more rationally than citizens.</p>
<p>Every shareholder gets to vote for someone to sign blocks in their stead (a representative if you will). Anyone who can gain 1% or more of the votes can join the board. The representatives become a “board of directors” which take turns in a round-robin manner, signing blocks. If one of the directors misses their turn, clients will automatically switch their vote away from them. Eventually these directors will be voted off the board and someone else will join. Board members are paid a small token to make it worth their time ensuring uptime and an incentive to campaign. They also post a small bond equal to 100x the average pay they receive for producing a single block. To make a profit a director must have greater than 99% uptime.</p>

<p>So how is this different than Bitcoin? With Bitcoin, users must pick a mining pool and each pool generally has 10% or more of the hash power. The operator of these pools is like a representative of the clients pointed at the pool. Bitcoin expects the users to switch pools to keep power from becoming too centralized, but collectively five major pools control the network and manual user intervention is expected if one of the pools is compromised. If a pool goes down then the block production rate slows proportionally until it comes back up. Which pool one mines with becomes a matter of politics.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>High probability they are not online.</li>

<li>Without any mining at all, the generation of a random number in a decentralized manner is impossible and thus an attacker could control the random number generation.</li>

<p>Assuming a fixed validation cost per transaction and a fixed fee per transaction, there is a limit to the amount of decentralization that can take place. Assuming the validation cost exactly equals the fee, a network is completely centralized and can only afford one validator. Assuming the fee is 100x the cost of validation, the network can support 100 validators.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/Scalability.png"><img alt="Green is Income, Yellow is Profit, Blue is Cost" class="align-center" src="_images/Scalability.png" style="width: 660px;" /></a>
<p>Systems like Nxt and Peercoin will have excessive fees if they intend to allow everyone to be a validator and earn fees at scale. What this means for Nxt and Peercoin is that anyone with less than 1% stake cannot validate profitably unless their fees are higher than our DPOS chain. If these chains assume 100 delegates is too centralized and start promoting they have 1000 validators, then their fees must be 10x those of DPOS. If such a chain grew to be the size of Bitcoin ($10 B) then only those with $1M worth of coin could validate profitably and most would consider that an elite club. If they reduce the minimum stake to be a validator to $1000, then their fees would be 10,000 times higher than DPOS.</p>
<p>Developers of DPOS assume that everyone with less than the amount required to validate won’t participate. Also assumed is a “reasonable” distribution of wealth. It’s clear that unless alternate chains have unusually high fees, there will only be a handful of people with enough stake to validate profitably.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the only way for POS to work efficiently is to delegate. In the case of Nxt, they can pool their stake by some means and ultimately this will end up like DPOS prior to approval voting with a variable number of delegates. Delegates wouldn’t actually receive any income as with mining pools because the validation expenses will consume the vast majority of the transaction fees.</p>
<p>The end result is that decentralization has a cost proportional to the number of validators and that costs do not disappear. At scale, these costs will centralize any system that does not support delegation. This kind of centralization should be designed as part of the system from the beginning so that it can be properly managed and controlled by the users, instead of evolving in some ad hoc manner as an unintended consequence.</p>

<p>In contrast to all satoshi-based clients, BitShares 2.0 offers a variety of blockchain tokens. There is not just the BTS (core token) but many others. Hence, as an exchange you need to distinguish different assets, either by their id (1.3.0 (BTS), 1.3.1 (USD), …) or by there symbol.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Registered Identities</a><a class="headerlink" href="#registered-identities" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>All participants in BitShares 2.0 are required to have a registered unique name. This is similar to mail addresses and are used to address recipients for transfers. As an exchange you will only ever need to tell your customers your BitShares account name and they will be able to send you funds.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">No More Addresses</a><a class="headerlink" href="#no-more-addresses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In BitShares 2.0, we have separated the permissions from the identity. Hence, as an exchange you don’t need to ever deal with addresses again. In fact, you actually cannot possibly use an address because they only define so called <em>authorities</em> that can control the funds (or the account name). This should greatly simplify integration as you don’t need to store thousands of addresses and their corresponding private keys.</p>

<p>In order to distinguish customers, we make use of so called <em>memos</em> similar to BitShares 1, which are encrypted. In contrast to BitShares 1.0, we now have a separated memo key that is only capable of decoding your memo and cannot spend funds. Hence, in order to monitor deposits to the exchange you no longer need to expose the private key to an internet connected machine. Instead you only decode the memo and leave the funds where they are.</p>

<span id="uia"></span><h3>User Issued Assets (UIAs)<a class="headerlink" href="#user-issued-assets-uias" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>BitShares allows individuals and companies to create and issue their own tokens for anything they can imagine. The potential use cases for so called user-issued assets (UIA) are innumerable. On the one hand, UIAs can be used as simple event tickets deposited on the customers mobile phone to pass the entrance of a concert. On the other hand, they can be used for crowd funding, ownership tracking or even to sell equity of a company in form of stock.</p>
<p>All you need to do is click in order to create a new UIA is a few mouse clicks, define your preferred parameters for your coin, such as supply, precision, symbol, description and see your coin’s birth after only a few seconds. From that point on, you can issue some of your coins to whomever you want, sell them and see them instantly <strong>traded against any other existing coin</strong> on BitShares.</p>
<p>Unless you want some restriction. As the issuer, you have certain privileges over your coin, for instance, you can allow trading only in certain market pairs and define who actually is allowed to hold your coin by using white- and blacklists. Of course, an issuer can opt-out of his privileges indefinitely for the sake of trust and reputation.</p>
<p>As the owner of that coin, you don’t need to take care of all the technical details of blockchain technology, such as distributed
consensus algorithms, blockchain development or integration. You don’t even need to run any mining equipment or servers, at all.</p>
<p>So what’s the drawback?</p>
<p>There is a drawback in this scenario, namely, a centralized issuance of new tokens. To some extend, this could be managed by a hierarchical multi-signature issuer account that prevents any single entity from issuing new coins but instead requires a consensus among an arbitrary set of people to agree on any changes to the coin.</p>
<p>Obviously, the regulations that apply to each kind of token vary widely and are often different in every jurisdiction. Hence, BitShares comes with tools that allow issuers to remain compliant with all applicable regulations when issuing assets assuming regulators allow such assets in the first place.</p>

<p><strong>Market-Pegged Assets (MPA)</strong></p>
<p>These SmartCoins track the value of an underlaying asset, such as Gold, or U.S. Dollar. Smartcoins can be created by anyone contracting with the BitShares ecosystem and putting sufficient BTS (at least 175%) into the so called contract for difference as collateral.</p>
<div class="toctree-wrapper compound">
<span id="document-bts_holders/tokens/mpa"></span><div class="section" id="market-pegged-assets-mpas">
<span id="mpa"></span><h3>Market Pegged Assets (MPAs)<a class="headerlink" href="#market-pegged-assets-mpas" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A crypto-currency, with the properties and advantages of Bitcoin, that
is capable of maintaining price parity with a globally adopted currency
(e.g. U.S.  dollar), has high utility for convenient and censorship
resistant commerce. This can be achieved by BitShares’ market pegged
assets (MPA), a new type of freely traded digital asset whose value is
meant to track the value of a conventional underlying asset by means of
contracts for difference (CFD).</p>
<p>Instead of creating a UIA where the full control over supply is in the
hands of the issuer, we can also create a <strong>Market Pegged Asset</strong> (MPA)
and let the market deal with demand and supply. All we need is a <em>fair
price</em> and another asset that can be used as collateral.</p>
<p>Why would we need <em>collateral</em> for? Since the issuer of a MPA has no
control over the supply, the blockchain protocol deals with increasing
and decreasing supply. In order for a user to get some of the new coins,
he will need to put collateral into a <strong>smart contract</strong> (technically,
this contract is a <em>contract for difference</em>).</p>
<p>&gt; A simple example would be a MPA that is backed by USD (a stable crypto token within BitShares) that requires a collateral ratio of 200%. Then, in order to get new coin, we can borrow 100 USD worth of new coins by paying 200 USD.</p>
<p>By this, the supply of your coin is increased by 100. But how would it
be decreased? The USD are locked in the smart contract and can only be
reclaimed if the debt (here, 100 coins) are returned. Returning them
will result in the coins being removed from the supply because the are
no longer backed by any collateral.</p>
<p>So what for do we need a <em>fair price</em>? Remember that we chose a
collateral ratio of 200%? That number tells us how well <em>backed</em> your
coins are by the collateral. But what would happen if the value of your
coin goes to the moon?  Then your collateral ratio will reduce to say
150%. At a certain percentage, the blockchain will automatically trigger
so called <em>Margin Calls</em> which will</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Take your collateral (here, USD)</li>
<li>Sell it in the market to buy back the coin you owe</li>
<li>Close the contract</li>
<li>Pay your the residual USD</li>
</ol>
<p>A <em>fair price</em> thus tells the market what your coin is worth (e.g.
traded for on external exchanges) and triggers margin calls if
necessary.</p>
<p>But there is more! Everyone that holds your (MPA) coin in BitShares can
convert the coin into the backing asset at a fair price. This procedure
is called “settlement” and ensures that your MPA is always worth <strong>at
least</strong> the <em>fair price</em>.</p>
<p>In the User Interface, MPAs are easily distinguishable from UIAs in the
asset explorer.</p>

<h4>SmartCoins<a class="headerlink" href="#smartcoins" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>

<h4>Collateralized Tokens<a class="headerlink" href="#collateralized-tokens" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A <em>SmartCoin</em> (synonym for MPA) is a crypto-currency that <em>always</em> has 100% or more of its value backed by the BitShares core currency (BTS), to which they can be converted at any time, as <em>collateral</em> in a CFD.</p>
<p>What makes MPAs unique is that they are free from counterparty risk even though they resemble a CFD backed by collateral. This is achievable by letting the network itself (implemented as a software protocol) be responsible for securing the collateral and performing settlements as will be described in more detail below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="market-mechanics">
<h4>Market Mechanics<a class="headerlink" href="#market-mechanics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Each BitAsset has a feed that is provided by the witnesses that indicate a fair price for that asset. This so called <em>Settlement Price</em> or <em>Feed Price</em> is used to margin call positions that borrowed BitAssets and can no longer maintain the minimum collateral ratio (i.e. maintenance collateral ratio). The collateral of these positions is used to buy back the debt from the market automatically and the position will be closed. By these rules, the network enforces the exchange participants to always maintain a collateral that is higher than the minimum requirement. Currently, the minimum required collateral ratio is <strong>175%</strong> and can be
changed by the witnesses.</p>

<p><strong>Exchange Backed Assets (EBA)</strong></p>
<p>This kind of asset is commonly known as I owe you (IOU). It represents the right to withdraw the same amount (minus fees) of a backing asset from a central entity. Often they are issued by a bank, an exchange or an other financial institute to represent deposit receipts.</p>

<p>Exchange Backed Assets represent deposit receipts that are issued by a centralized entity, such as exchanges, banks or other institutes. These can either be interpreted as <em>I owe you</em> (IOUs) or certificates for a deposit at that institute.</p>
<p>From the blockchain perspective, EBA are equivalent to a <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#uia"><span class="std std-ref">User Issued Assets (UIAs)</span></a> that is created and issued by an exchange, bank or financial institute. Hence, it is their responsibility to credit you with the corresponding blockchain token (the EBA) on deposits.</p>
<div class="section" id="use-case">
<h4>Use Case<a class="headerlink" href="#use-case" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The most common use case would be a centralized exchange that allows their users to deposit crypto currencies in their wallets. These
deposits are usually stored in their own database and the customers internal account balance is matched accordingly. These database balances serve as <strong>deposit receipts</strong> but obviously require some trust that the database is properly secured against any kind of attacks.</p>
<p>Instead of increasing an internal account balance of a user, new shares of an EBA can be issued to the user on deposits. Since EBAs are
blockchain tokens, they can be traded on the decentralized exchange similar to any other exchange.</p>
<p>In order to reclaim his crypto tokens on their native blockchain, the users sends back the EBAs to the institute who then destroy the EBAs and transfer the corresponding asset back to its rightful owner.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Since EBAs are implemented as UIA, you can read more about the underlying technology on the <a class="reference internal" href="index.html#uia"><span class="std std-ref">corresponding page - UIA</span></a>.</p>

<p><strong>Privatized Bit-Assets</strong></p>
<p>A flexible mixture between UIA and MPA that allows 3rd parties to create their own customized MPAs.</p>

<span id="privbta"></span><h3>Privatized BitAssets<a class="headerlink" href="#privatized-bitassets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Alternatively to regular MPA like the bitUSD, BitShares also offers entrepreneurs an opportunity to create their own SmartCoins with custom parameters and a distinct set of price feed producers.</p>
<p>Privatized SmartCoin managers can experiment with different parameters such as collateral requirements, price feeds, force settlement delays and forced settlement fees. They also earn the trading fees from transactions the issued asset is involved in, and therefore have a financial incentive to market and promote it on the network. The entrepreneur who can discover and market the best set of parameters can earn a significant profit.  The set of parameters that can be tweaked by entrepreneurs is broad enough that SmartCoins can be used to implement a fully functional prediction market with a guaranteed global settlement at a fair price, and no forced settlement before the resolution date.</p>
<p>Some entrepreneurs may want to experiment with SmartCoins that always trade at exactly $1.00 rather than strictly more than $1.00. They can do this by manipulating the forced settlement fee continuously such that the average trading price stays at about $1.00. By default, BitShares prefers fees set by the market, and thus opts to let the price float above $1.00, rather than fixing the price by directly manipulating the forced settlement fee.</p>

<p><strong>Fee Backed Assets</strong></p>
<p>An FBA is a token that pays you a fraction of the transaction fees generated by a particular feature that has been funded independent of BitShares.</p>

<p>Existing core features of the BitShares protocol are Market Pegged Assets (MPA) and issuer backed User Issued Assets (UIA). In this proposal, we introduce another type of asset: <em>Fee Backed Assets (FBA)</em>.</p>
<p>Feed backed assets allow to propose and fund <em>market based</em> innovation by sharing a cut of future profits generated by this particular innovation with the people that helped fund it. Think of it as a <em>Kickstarter</em> for features. Hence, if people can profit from successful features in the form of fees then it can help the BitShares ecosystem to become more adaptable over time as it promotes innovation and can pay for its development.</p>
<p>If you have any features in mind that require new kind of transaction on the blockchain, you can code that feature and fund it with an FBA.</p>
<p>Feed Backed Assets have been proposed in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bitshares/bsips/blob/master/bsip-0007.md">BSIP-0007</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Prediction Market Asset</strong></p>
<p>A prediction market is similar to a MPA, that trades between 0 and 1, only. After an event, a price feed can be used to determine which option to take and participants can settle at this price.</p>

<span id="pm"></span><h3>Prediction Markets<a class="headerlink" href="#prediction-markets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A prediction market is a specialized BitAsset such that total debt and total collateral are always equal amounts (although asset IDs differ). No margin calls or force settlements may be performed on a prediction market asset. A prediction market is globally settled by the issuer after the event being predicted resolves, thus a prediction market must always have the <cite>global_settle</cite> permission enabled. The maximum price for global settlement or short sale of a prediction market asset is 1-to-1.</p>

<div class="section" id="betting-for-a-positive-outcome">
<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Betting for a Positive Outcome</a><a class="headerlink" href="#betting-for-a-positive-outcome" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>If you are confident that the bet will resolve positive, you want to <strong>hold</strong> that particular PM-asset since it allows you to settle it for it’s collateral on a 1:1 basis.</p>
<p>In order to get hold of those tokens, you can put a buy order for them at any price (between 0 and 1) and wait for it to be filled, or buy at market rates. By this technique, a user can pre define at which odds to buy shares.</p>
<p>For instance, if you think that the bet resolves positively at a probability of <cite>80%</cite>, you can put your buy order at a price of <cite>0.8</cite>. If the bet resolves positively (price feed of <cite>1</cite>), then you can settle your shares at <cite>1</cite> and make a 20% profit.</p>
<p>If you can buy tokens at a price of <cite>0.2</cite> (i.e. market participants think it is unlikely to resolve positively), then you could make <cite>80%</cite> profits at a risk of loosing with <cite>80%</cite> probability.</p>
<p>After closing of the bet, a user can claim his profits by <strong>settling</strong> his borrow position and taking out the collateral:</p>

<p>If the bet resolves negatively (price feed of <cite>0</cite>), your debts is worth <cite>debt = amount * price = 0 BTS</cite>, you can reclaim your collateral at zero cost, and get to keep <cite>20%</cite> profits from selling the token at <cite>0.2</cite>.

<p>The blockchain can and needs to be governed by <strong>elected</strong> individuals and businesses. The so called <em>committee</em> (a set of many individuals), can change blockchain parameters such as block size, block confirmation time and others. Most importantly, though, they deal with the business plan of the blockchain and tweak costs and revenue streams (mainly transaction fees). In contrast to most existing crypto currencies, we re not hoping for a fee market to grow but instead have the committee members deal with fine-tuning of the business plan. Fortunately, the BTS Holders have the final say to approve the executive committee.</p>
<p>Hence, we see businesses competing for seats in the committee to define blockchain parameters.</p>
<p>If business ideas requires certain blockchain parameters or a particular set of fees to be profitable, there are several options:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Argue with shareholders to approve committee members that vote in their favor</li>
<li>Get elected as committee member by showing that the business is worth being available in that particular chain</li>
<li>Deploy the innovative business idea as a smart contract on the blockchain and have the shareholders approve the upgrade in combination with <em>Fee Backed Asset</em> that pays future fees of the smart contract to holders of that asset (<a class="reference internal" href="index.html#fba"><span class="std std-ref">Fee Backed Asset</span></a>)</li>

<p>In contrast to most crypto-currencies, BitShares does not claim to be a currency but rather an <em>equity</em> in a decentral autonomous company (DAC). As a result, the market valuation of BitShares is free floating and may be as volatile as any other equity (e.g. of traditional companies).</p>
<p>Every entity hold the core token (BTS) is considered a BTS Holder of the BitShares decentralized company.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, BTS tokens can be used as <em>collateral</em> in financial smart contracts such as market pegged assets and thus back every existing smartcoin such as the bitUSD.</p>

<div class="section" id="committees">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Committees</a><a class="headerlink" href="#committees" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since Bitcoin struggled to reach a consensus about the size of their blocks, the people in the cryptocurrency space realized that the governance of a DAC should not be ignored. Hence, BitShares offers a tools to reach on-chain consensus about business management decisions.</p>
<p>The BitShares blockchain has a set of parameters available that are subject of BTS Holder approval. BTS Holders can define their preferred set of parameters and thereby create a so called <em>committee member</em> or alternatively vote for an existing committee member. The BitShares committee consists of several <em>active</em> committee members.</p>
<p>The BitShares ecosystem has a set of parameters available that are subject of BTS Holder approval. Initially, BitShares has the following blockchain parameters:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>fee structure</strong>:         <em>fess that have to be paid by customers for individual transactions</em></li>
<li><strong>block interval</strong>:        <em>i.e. block interval, max size of block/transaction</em></li>
<li><strong>expiration parameters</strong>: <em>i.e. maximum expiration interval</em></li>
<li><strong>witness parameters</strong>:    <em>i.e. maximum amount of witnesses (block producers)</em></li>
<li><strong>committee parameters</strong>:  <em>i.e. maximum amount of committee members</em></li>
<li><strong>witness pay</strong>:           <em>payment for each witnesses per signed block</em></li>
<li><strong>worker budget</strong>:         <em>available budget available for budget items (e.g. development)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the given set of parameters serves as an example and that the network’s parameters are subject to change over time.</p>
<p>Additionally to defining the parameters any active witness can propose a protocol or business upgrade (i.e. hard fork) which can be voted on (or against) by BTS Holders. When the total votes for the hard fork are greater than the median witness weight <cite>w</cite> then the hard fork takes effect.</p>

<div class="section" id="witnesses">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">Witnesses</a><a class="headerlink" href="#witnesses" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In BitShares, the witnesses’ job is to collect transactions, bundle them into a block, sign the block and broadcast it to the network. They essentially are the block producers for the underlying consensus mechanism.</p>
<p>For each successfully constructed block, a witness is payed in shares that are taken from the limited reserves pool at a rate that is defined by the BTS Holders by means of approval voting.</p>

<div class="section" id="payouts">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6">Payouts</a><a class="headerlink" href="#payouts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A blockchain parameter (defined by BTS Holders through the committee) defines the daily available budget. No more than that can be paid at any time to all workers combined.</p>
<p>The daily budget is distributed as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The available budget is taken out of reserves pool.</li>
<li>The budget items are sorted according to their approval rate (<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Pro</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">Con</span></code>) in a descending order.</li>
<li>Starting at the worker with the highest approval rate, the requested daily pay is payed until the daily budget is depleted.</li>
<li>The worker with the least approval rate that was paid may receive less than the requested pay</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, in order to be successfully funded by the BitShares ecosystem, the BTS Holders approval for your budget item needs to be highly ranked.</p>
<p>Since the payments for workers from the non-liquid reserve pool result in an increased supply of BTS, these payments are vesting over a period of time defined by BTS Holders.</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Separation of Powers</strong>:
There is no reason why the same entity needs to be responsible for issuing IOUs and for processing the order book. In BitShares, order matching is performed by the protocol, which is unaware of implications concerning the involved assets.</li>
<li><strong>Global Unified Order Book</strong>:
Since BitShares is global, anybody with an internet access can use the DEX for trading. This brings the world’s liquidity to a single order book for decentralized trading.</li>
<li><strong>Trade Almost Anything</strong>:
The BitShares DEX is asset agnostic. Hence you can trade at <strong>any</strong> pair. While some pairs may end up with low liquidity, such as SILVER:GOLD, other pairs such as USD:EUR for FOREX trading will see huge volume.</li>
<li><strong>No Limits</strong>:
The BitShares protocol is unable to limit your trading experience.</li>
<li><strong>Decentralized</strong>:
The DEX is decentralized across the globe. This not only means that there is no single point of failure, but it also implies that the BitShares exchange is open for trading 24/7 because it’s always daytime somewhere.</li>
<li><strong>Secure</strong>:
Your funds and trades are secured with industry-grade elliptic curve cryptography. No one will be able to access your funds unless you let them. To further strengthen the security, we allow our customers to setup escrow and multi-signature schemes.</li>
<li><strong>Fast</strong>:
In contrast to other decentralized networks, the BitShares DEX allows for real-time trading and is only limited by the speed of light and the size of the planet.</li>
<li><strong>Provable Order Matching Algorithm</strong>:
What makes the BitShares DEX unique is the provable order matching algorithm. Given a set of orders, you will always be able to provably verify that these orders have been matched properly.</li>
<li><strong>Collateralized Smartcoins</strong>:
One of the biggest features of BitShares are its <em>smartcoins</em> such as bitUSD, bitEUR, bitCNY, and others. For the sake of convenience, these assets are denotes simply as USD, EUR, CNY, etc. in the wallet. These digital tokens
represent the same value as their underlaying physical asset. Hence 1 USD in this wallet is worth $1 and can be redeemed as such. Any of these tokens is backed by BitShares’ company shares (BTS) being locked up as collateral and being available for settlement at its current price.</li>

<p>In BitShares, almost any asset can be traded with all other assets. Once we have picked two assets, we usually refer to a <em>market pair</em>. For instance, we can trade USD against EUR in the USD:EUR pair.</p>
<p>For sake of consistency, we will use the generalized terms <em>base</em> and <em>quote</em> such that pairs are represented as:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">quote</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">base</span>

<p>The order book consists of an <em>ask</em> and a <em>bid</em> side. Since trading pairs do not have a preferred orientation, and can be flipped, the following table shall give an overview of ask/bid and the corresponding buy/sell operations for each side:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">

<p>Obviously, what is on the bid side of the USD:EUR pair will be on the ask side on the EUR:USD pair. Of course prices are internally represented as fractions, and thus results in both pairs being identical.</p>

<p>BitShares 2.0 matches orders on a first-come, first-serve basis and gives the buyer the best price possible up to the limit (also known as “walking the book”). Rather than charging <em>unpredictable fees</em> from market overlap (as has been in the previous network), the network charges a defined fee based upon the size of the order matched and the assets involved. Each asset issuer gets an opportunity to configure their fees.</p>

<p>The decentralized exchange (DEX) of BitShares has a similar look&amp;feel as traditional centralized exchanges. However, trading in the DEX can have many different appearances, depending on what user-interface is used. We here describe the user interface of the official wallet.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">Margin Call</a><a class="headerlink" href="#margin-call" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The BitShares network is capable of margin calling those positions that do not have enough collateral to back their borrowed bitAssets. A margin call will occur any time the highest bid is less than the <em>call price</em> and greater than <em>SQP</em>.
The margin position will be forced to sell its collateral anytime the highest offer to buy the collateral is less than the call price (x/BTS).:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">SQP</span>        <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">settlement</span> <span class="n">price</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="n">MSQR</span>

<p>The margin call will take the collateral, buy shares of borrowed bitAsset at market rates up to the SQP and close the position. The remaining BTS of the collateral are returned to the customer.</p>

<p>Holders of any bitAsset can request a settlement at a <em>fair price</em> at any time. The settlement closes the borrow/short positions with lowest collateral ratio and sells the collateral for the settlement.</p>
<p>Note, that there is a maximum daily settlement volume (currently 2%) defined by the committee to prevent exploitation via external price movements.</p>

<div class="section" id="discussion">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id7">Discussion</a><a class="headerlink" href="#discussion" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Shorts can pick their place in line for settlement. Think of it this way, if you fall in the bottom 2% of shorters by collateral you have been given notice of potential margin call since only 2% can be settled, daily. This is like any other market where they give you 24 hours to add collateral. If someone is short and doesn’t want to meet the new higher collateral limits then they can either cover on their own terms or add collateral.</p>
<p>By giving 24 hours shorts have an opportunity to cover prior to any price manipulation by big players.</p>
<p>If there is a 10% premium on BitUSD relative to the feed, then the attacker would have to increase reported price feed (value of BTS) by 10% just to get the force-settlement price to equal the previously fair value for BitUSD. They would have to push beyond 10% before the short starts taking a loss relative to a voluntary cover. All savvy market participants would be aware of a large force-settle order and would therefore reset the manipulator making it much harder to manipulate the price. In effect, price manipulation represents “free money” to those who know it is going on.</p>
<p>Look at it another way, someone enters a large force-settlement order it becomes an opportunity for the shorter to do reverse manipulation. It is a tug of war where both sides (short and long) have equal opportunity to manipulate the market in their favor. They go to battle and the result is just the fair market price at that point in time. It is not a guaranteed win for the potential
manipulator.</p>

<p>The mechanics of a margin call in Bitshares are currently poorly understood, so I’d like to try to clarify a little by using examples from the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">USD:BTS</span></code> market. I think part of the current confusion lies in people talking about the same market but using different market directions, ie. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">USD:BTS</span></code> or <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">BTS:USD</span></code>, so terms like above/below don’t mean the same thing to different people. I will only use USD in these examples, but USD can be replaced by any bit asset in this context. I prefer to use the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">USD:BTS</span></code> market direction, so these examples will have prices in BTS/USD.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id1">What is a margin call?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-a-margin-call" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A margin call is the market forcing you to sell your collateral in order to buy enough USD to close your position. In the USD:BTS market a margin call is equivalent to a bid: it is an order to buy USD for BTS.</p>
<p>A margin call will happen because the price has increased to the point where your collateral is insufficient with respect to the current collateral requirements of the Bitshares market rules. The required collateral is a tuneable parameter in Bitshares, set by the maintenance collateral ratio (MCR) which is maintained by the feed producers (i.e., the witnesses).</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id2">How is the call price calculated?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#how-is-the-call-price-calculated" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>As mentioned above the call price of a margin position depends on the MCR and the amount of debt and collateral in your position. It is independent of the price feed (settlement price). As an example, say you have opened the following position:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Debt: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">10</span> <span class="pre">USD</span></code></li>
<li>Collateral: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">10000</span> <span class="pre">BTS</span></code></li>
<li>MCR is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1.75</span></code></li>
</ul>
<p>The call price of your position is  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">10000</span> <span class="pre">BTS</span> <span class="pre">/</span> <span class="pre">(10</span> <span class="pre">*</span> <span class="pre">1.75</span> <span class="pre">USD)</span> <span class="pre">=</span>&#160; <span class="pre">571.429</span> <span class="pre">BTS/USD</span></code>.</p>

<p>The collateral ratio depends on the feed price (settlement price). Taking a feed price of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">300</span> <span class="pre">BTS/USD</span></code> and building on the above example with <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">10</span> <span class="pre">USD</span></code> debt and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">10000</span> <span class="pre">BTS</span></code> collateral:</p>

<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">When will a margin call happen?</a><a class="headerlink" href="#when-will-a-margin-call-happen" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>This is where it gets complicated. Margin Call are only possible if the feed price is below your call price. A margin call will happen whenever the squeeze protection price goes above the call price of your position. To better understand how this works, let’s go back to our margin position and look at collateral ratios:</p>
<p>Say we have the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Debt: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">10</span> <span class="pre">USD</span></code></li>
<li>Settlement price: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">300</span> <span class="pre">BTS/USD</span></code></li>
<li>CR: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1</span></code></li>
<li>Collateral is therefore <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">3000</span> <span class="pre">BTS</span></code></li>
</ul>
<p>This is also known as the Black Swan level, and we want to perform a margin call before the collateral ratio goes this low. This is why we have the Maintenance Collateral Ratio (MCR), to enforce a buffer zone before a position goes into Black Swan territory. So if we apply the MCR of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1.75</span></code> to this position:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Debt: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">10</span> <span class="pre">USD</span></code></li>
<li>Settlement Price: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">300</span> <span class="pre">BTS/USD</span></code></li>
<li>CR: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1.75</span></code></li>
<li>Collateral is therefore <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">3000</span> <span class="pre">BTS</span> <span class="pre">*</span> <span class="pre">1.75</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">5250</span> <span class="pre">BTS</span></code></li>
</ul>
<p>This is much safer, there is a bit of margin for the position to be closed before going into Black Swan levels. Since in our example, the USD <strong>requires</strong> <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1.75</span></code> ratio, the call price of this position is now exactly equal to the feed price of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">300</span>
<span class="pre">BTS/USD</span></code>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Call price: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">5250</span> <span class="pre">/</span> <span class="pre">(10</span> <span class="pre">*</span> <span class="pre">1.75)</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">300</span> <span class="pre">BTS/USD</span></code></li>
</ul>
<p>The remaining question then is, at what point should we force the position to attempt to close itself? This is where the SQPR comes in. Let’s look at two scenarios, SQPR of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1.1</span></code> and SQPR of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1.5</span></code>:</p>

<p>Another way of looking at this is by looking at the Collateral Ratio of the position. If we want to stay at or above the squeeze protection price, what is the required collateral ratio? Let’s do the math:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Settlement Price: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">300</span> <span class="pre">BTS/USD</span></code></li>
<li>MCR: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1.75</span></code></li>
<li>SQPR: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1.1</span></code></li>
<li>Debt: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">10</span> <span class="pre">USD</span></code></li>
<li>Call price: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CP</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">SQPP</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">300</span> <span class="pre">*</span> <span class="pre">1.1</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">330</span> <span class="pre">BTS/USD</span></code></li>
<li>Collateral = <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(10</span> <span class="pre">USD</span> <span class="pre">*</span> <span class="pre">1.75)</span> <span class="pre">*</span> <span class="pre">330</span> <span class="pre">BTS/USD</span>&#160; <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">5775</span> <span class="pre">BTS</span></code></li>
</ul>
<p>The collateral ratio of this position is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">(5775</span> <span class="pre">BTS</span> <span class="pre">/</span> <span class="pre">300</span> <span class="pre">BTS/USD)</span> <span class="pre">/</span> <span class="pre">10</span> <span class="pre">USD</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">1.925</span></code>.</p>
<p>This is equivalent to the MCR</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>SQPR: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1.75</span> <span class="pre">*</span> <span class="pre">1.1</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">1.925</span></code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, in order to stay <strong>safe</strong> and not be margin called, the margin
position must maintain a collateral ratio higher than <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">MCR</span> <span class="pre">*</span> <span class="pre">SQPR</span></code>.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Safe position</strong>: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">CR</span> <span class="pre">&gt;</span> <span class="pre">MCR</span> <span class="pre">*</span> <span class="pre">SQPR</span></code></li>
</ul>

<p>This is the part I believe is most misunderstood, so I will use some screenshots of a fictional <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">USD:BTS</span></code> market to explain. We will use the following parameters:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>SQPR: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1.2</span></code></li>
<li>MCR: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1.75</span></code></li>
<li>SQPR * MCR:  <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2.1</span></code></li>
<li>Settlement price: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">300</span> <span class="pre">BTS/USD</span></code></li>
<li>Squeeze protection price: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">300</span> <span class="pre">*</span> <span class="pre">1.2</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">360</span> <span class="pre">BTS/USD</span></code></li>
<li>Debt: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">10</span> <span class="pre">USD</span></code></li>
<li>Collateral: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">5687.5</span></code></li>
<li>CR: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1.896</span></code></li>
<li>Call price: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">325</span> <span class="pre">BTS/USD</span></code></li>
</ul>
<p>From what we’ve seen above, it’s clear that this position should be margin
called: it has a CR of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">1.896</span></code> which is well below the safe ratio of 2.1.</p>
<p>It will therefore get added to the order book as a bid to buy USD like this:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/margin-buyregion.png"><img alt="Margin Call Buy Region" class="align-center" src="_images/margin-buyregion.png" style="width: 800px;" /></a>
<p>The margin called order will buy any USD priced in the range <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">325-360</span> <span class="pre">BTS/USD</span></code>. The squeeze protection price acts as a price ceiling, meaning the forced margin order will not execute at a very high price in an illiquid market: it is protected from high prices by the SQPR.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="margin-calls-only-execute-in-the-range-call-price-sqpp">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id10">Margin calls only execute in the range [Call Price - SQPP]</a><a class="headerlink" href="#margin-calls-only-execute-in-the-range-call-price-sqpp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A margin call will occur any time the lowest ask is higher than the call price and lower than the SQPP. This has several consequences, as we will see below. It can create some very strange situations, and also force the margin called orders to “buy high”.</p>
<p><strong>Consequence #1</strong>: Asks below the call price prevent margin calls from executing</p>
<p>Because margin calls only execute in the range Call Price - SQPP, if there is a sell order for <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">5</span> <span class="pre">USD</span></code> at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">315</span> <span class="pre">BTS/USD</span></code> in this market, the call order will not use it, which makes the market look like this:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/margin-not-cheap.png"><img alt="Margin Calls can't buy cheap" class="align-center" src="_images/margin-not-cheap.png" style="width: 800px;" /></a>
<p>If a second sell order of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">2.5</span> <span class="pre">USD</span></code> were added at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">345</span> <span class="pre">BTS/USD</span></code>, the margin called order would still not buy any USD because of the “blocking” sell order at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">315</span> <span class="pre">BTS/USD</span></code>:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/margin-not-cheap-2.png"><img alt="Margin Calls can't buy cheap" class="align-center" src="_images/margin-not-cheap-2.png" style="width: 800px;" /></a>
<p>If the order at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">315</span> <span class="pre">BTS/USD</span></code> were to be removed, either from being canceled or from being filled, the order at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">345</span> <span class="pre">BTS/USD</span></code> would instantly get filled by the margin called order, and the margin called position would have a reduced debt of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">10</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">2.5</span> <span class="pre">=</span> <span class="pre">7.5</span> <span class="pre">USD</span></code>:</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/margin-execute.png"><img alt="Margin Call executes" class="align-center" src="_images/margin-execute.png" style="width: 800px;" /></a>
<p><strong>Consequence #2</strong>: Margin calls cannot “buy cheap” As we’ve seen above, unless the settlement price goes above the call price of the position, forced margin calls always buy at a premium relative to the settlement price. Even if there are sell orders available at or near the feed price, the margin called orders will not be matched with those sell orders if their call price is higher than the price of those sell orders.</p>

<p><strong>Links take to (https://bitshares.org/) information pages.</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Votable Network Parameters</strong>:
BitShares 2.0 will allow its BTS Holders to fine-tune any parameter available to the protocol. This includes, block size, block interval, but also the payment for block producers and transaction fees.</li>
<li><strong>Flexible and Dynamic Access Control</strong>:
BitShares 2.0 allows customers and participants a flexible and dynamic access to its funds or account handle. A so called <em>Authority</em> can consist of a flat hierarchy similar to <em>multi-signature</em> in Bitcoin, but could also support tree hierarchies never to be seen before. Read more about this about <a class="reference external" href="https://bitshares.org/technology/dynamic-account-permissions">dynamic account permissions</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Transferable Account Names</strong>:
Since Control over Funds is separated from the control over an account, we can have transferable account names that are registered on the blockchain. Named accounts allows for much easier transfers because no cryptic strings needs to be handed out. Read more about <a class="reference external" href="https://bitshares.org/technology/named-accounts">transferable named accounts</a>.</li>
<li><strong>On-Chain Proposed Transactions</strong>:
In traditional crypto currencies, a multi-signature transaction has to be transfered to its corresponding signers on separated communication channels (off-chain). BitShares 2.0 allows to propose transactions on the chain and have the signers be notified for their required signature automatically. No more manual communications are required.</li>
<li><strong>New Full-Node/Client Concept</strong>:
We recognize the hassles some people had when synchronizing the BitShares 1.0 blockchain with the heavy-weighted BitShares full client. In order to offer more comfort and a faster trading experience, we decided to separated the user-interface from the block syncing core component that connects to the peer-to-peer network. Of course, both are open source and a full node can run
easily, we understand that some users mainly prefer to use the frontend not bothering about the blockchain.</li>
<li><strong>Referral Program</strong>:
PayPal and Dwolla showed the success of referral programs, a program that could easily and cheaper be implemented in a decentralized software protocol. Hence we took our chance and implemented a blockchain based referral program. From every transaction fee, paid by a customer you referred, you will get a fraction. Of course, this fraction can be tuned by BTS Holders! Read more about the <a class="reference external" href="https://bitshares.org/technology/referral-rewards-program">referral program</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Recurring &amp; Scheduled Payments</strong>:
We wanted to offer a way to have our rent payed automatically. So we implemented it in the blockchain. In BitShares 2.0, participants are capable of allowing others to withdraw funds from your account. Of course, you can define a daily/weekly or monthly limit. Read more about <a class="reference external" href="https://bitshares.org/technology/recurring-scheduled-payments">recurring and scheduled payments</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Privatized BitAssets</strong>:
In contrast to Market Pegged Assets (also known as BitAssets) that have a price feed published by witnesses that have approval of BTS Holders, a <em>privatized</em> bitasset allows to create market pegged assets that have an individual set of price feed publishers that do not need BTS Holders’ approval. Hence, everyone can create a privatized bitAsset to track an individual value, such as indices, or binary predictions.</li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>BitAssets are Contracts-For-Difference</strong>:
Our research has identified an improved mechanism to achieve a solid <em>peg</em> of bitAssets to its underlay. BitAssets like the bitUSD in BitShares 2.0 will always trade for <em>at least</em> the value of its underlying asset, i.e. $1. We have summarized the economical analysis and incentives for market participants here: <a class="reference external" href="https://bitshares.org/technology/price-stable-cryptocurrencies">bitAssets 2.0</a></li>
<li><strong>Faster Blocks</strong>:
Initially, the BitShares 2.0 blockchain will come with 3 seconds block interval with the option to reduce down to 1 second if BTS Holders agree.</li>
<li><strong>Industrial Performance</strong>:
BitShares 2.0 can support massive load and works well beyond 100k transactions per second. Find out how we achieve <a class="reference external" href="https://bitshares.org/technology/industrial-performance-and-scalability">industrial performance and scalability</a>.</li>
<li><strong>New Reactive UI</strong>:
The BitShares 1.0 user interface was powerful but lacking in responsiveness and performance. For Bitshares 2.0 we’ve reimplemented the whole wallet using the React.js framework developed by Facebook, which is well-known for having excellent performance. The new BitShares UI is an entirely browser-based wallet, with private keys maintained in the browser. We expect a flourishing ecosystem of forked and tweaked wallets based off of our UI.</li>
<li><strong>Accounts must be registered</strong>:
In BitShares 2.0 we have separated <em>authorities</em> from transaction partners. Hence, if Alice wants to send funds to Bob, it may be required that only Celine signs for that transaction. Also, BitShares 2.0 has <a class="reference external" href="https://bitshares.org/technology/referral-rewards-program">a referral program</a>. Both features combined make it necessary that participants <em>register</em> an account on the blockchain.</li>
<li><strong>No more Hierarchies in Account Names</strong>:
In BitShares 1, there have been hierarchies in account names. Namely, you could only create a sub-account <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">home.wallet</span></code> if you also owned <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wallet</span></code>. In BitShares 2.0, these hierarchies no longer exist and to register <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">home.wallet</span></code> you don’t need to own <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">wallet</span></code>.</li>
<li><strong>Explicit Privacy</strong>:
The <em>TITAN</em> technology in BitShares 2.0 slowed down blockchain processing significantly. Because of this and because TITAN did not really offer good privacy, we eliminated TITAN as a default transaction feature.  Hence: <strong>Account transactions are public now as well.</strong> However, since we recognize the value of financial privacy, we offer <em>blinded</em> transactions that hide the transferred <em>amount</em>, and <em>stealth</em> transactions that hide the sender and receiver. A combination of both is also possible.</li>
<li><strong>Prices are Fractions</strong>:
To circumvent rounding errors, all prices in BitShares 2.0 are represented as fractions.</li>
<li><strong>Delegates are now Witnesses and Payed Positions are now Budget Items</strong>:
Since we have separated the business part from the block producing part, we now call block producers (formerly known as <em>delegates</em>) witnesses, while the additional payed position for workers are called budget items.</li>

<p>BitShares 2.0 will be initialized with what is called a <em>Genesis Block</em>. That genesis block will be constructed from the balances of BitShares 1.0. BitShares 1.0 offers many features that need to be migrated into BitShares 2.0. To simplify the process and reduce the risk of errors, the following conditions will be met:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Funds</strong>:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>BTS Tokens</strong>: All BTS balances will be migrated 1:1. The supply not change!</li>
<li><strong>User-Issued-Assets</strong>: All UAI tokens will be migrated 1:1</li>
<li><strong>BitAssets</strong>: Because the new chain is a simple migration and should retain all the same “perceived value”, all BitAssets and short positions are migrated 1:1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Account Names</strong>:
Under BitShares 2.0, accounts are transferable and have different prices based upon the “quality” of the account name. Any “premium” names registered on or after 2015-06-08 (US Eastern time) will be given the prefix “bts-“ or similar after the migration. All account names registered on or after 2015-06-18 (US Eastern time) will be prefixed with “bts-” unless they were
registered using the BitShares Faucet.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Premium Name</strong>:  No numbers and has vowels</li>
<li><strong>Cheap Name</strong>:    Has numbers or no vowels</li>
</ul>
<p>All other account names will be migrated with their corresponding owner/active keys.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Open Orders</strong>:
Open orders (except open short positions) will <strong>not</strong> migrate and the funds will be credited to the corresponding owners.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Open Shorts</strong>:
Short orders will be migrated to BitShares 2.0 on a 1:1 ratio. You collateral will be imported as a separated account (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">usd-collateral-holder-124</span></code>) under your control.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Transaction History</strong>:
Transaction histories of BitShares 1.0 will be inaccessible in BitShares 2.0.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Vesting Balances</strong>:
Vesting balances will migrate under the existing terms, if two or more vesting balances were partially claimed as part of the same transaction prior to the snapshot the vesting balances may be merged into a single balance.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Unclaimed Delegate Pay</strong>:
Delegates that did not claim their pay prior to the snapshot will be able to claim their pay by importing their corresponding keys similar to any other balance.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Assets</strong>:
User issued assets and market pegged assets will migrated with their corresponding issuer and holders.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Deprecated Features</strong>:
Some features have turned out to be unreliable or impractical and will thus deprecate:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Wall Messages</strong> will not be migrated as the feature is now deprecated</li>
<li>Asset <strong>description information</strong> is no longer part of the blockchain state and will not be migrated</li>
<li>Account <strong>public data</strong> is deprecated and is no longer part of the blockchain state</li>
<li>BitShares URL scheme: <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">bts://</span></code> will be deprecated due to migration to hosted web wallets</li>

<p>When you first time connect to one of BitShares UI wallets, you will find <strong>Welcome to BitShares</strong> page. As a default, you will create a Cloud Wallet. You can imagine the Cloud Wallet smiler to your normal bank account. You remember your account name and a password and the bank manage and save your funds for you.</p>
<p>A Local Wallet, as opposed to a Cloud Wallet, is another type of Wallet. You create your account name and a password and also you have to manage your funds. That means you have to create your account backup files and keep them in a safe place.  The Local Wallet creation form is the advanced form. You can find the link on the same “Welcome to BitShares” page.</p>
<p>It’s important to understand that <strong>only</strong> you know your password, and no one can recover it.  The account information is registered to the blockchain with private/public keys of the account. Only the account creator knows the password and finds out the private keys. We will look into three types of keys (i.e., active, owner, and memo key) in anther section.</p>

<p>If you create an account at one of BitShares partners, the account name will be available among BitShares partners.  So, you will be able to use the BitShares account name to communicate (e.g., sending fund) with <strong>other BitShares account holders</strong> like sending an email. The advantage of using account name is you, and other people can identify the account holder.</p>

<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">Identifier</a><a class="headerlink" href="#identifier" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When you create a BitShares account, BitShares 2.0 registers the account name to the blockchain and also assigns an incrementing identifier (account id) during the registration. You will not need to remember the account_id while you use the BitShares wallet operations (i.e., send fund, place order, etc).</p>
<p>If you want to know your acount_id. go to a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cryptofresh.com/">cryptofresh</a> and search your account name. You will find your account id under your account name.</p>
<p><em>The identifier (account_id) comes with many advantages:</em>
Besides improved scalability, we have separated the identity from the transaction authorizing signature. In practice, owning an account name is autonomous from being able to spend its funds. Furthermore, both rights (we call them permissions) can split among an arbitrary complex relation of people (we call them authorities) using weights and required thresholds.</p>
<p>To separating authorities from identities, BitShares 2.0 can be much faster in processing delay while having much smaller transaction sizes. All participants are forced to have a named account on the blockchain. Also, most transactions are tied to the account name and can be linked to individuals (this includes transfers, trades, shorts, etc. but not stealthed transactions).</p>

<p>There are different Transaction Fee Types. And each operation has own transaction fee amount. Some operations ask Regular Transaction Fee and Price of per KByte Transaction Size.</p>
<p>For instance, <em>Transfer operation</em> asks both (Regular Transaction Fee and Price of per KByte Transaction Size) fees. The <em>Price per KByte Transaction Size</em> comes from a size of memo you send. The memo is encrypted by default and can only be decrypted by the participants of the transfer. It’s safe to use to sens a message. However, the transfer fee depends on the length of the memo.</p>
<p>You can use the memo section to send a message. Also, some transactions require you to input a necessary information in the memo section. Be sure if you put each information in a correct place before you confirm your transaction!</p>

<p>We talked about “Transfer Operation” Fees. Some of the transfer fees depend on the length of the memo.

<p><strong>50%</strong> of the asset creation fee is used to pre-fill the assets fee pool. From the other <strong>50%</strong>, <strong>20% go to the network and 80% go to the referral program</strong>. This means that if you are a lifetime member, you get back 40% of the asset creation fee after the vesting period (currently 90 days).</p>

<p>There are many ways to profit from issuing an asset. As the issuer you have complete control over market fees and can tune parameters such as the percent of each trade that is collected as a fee. This percentage can be bounded by a minimum and maximum fee. The combination of these three parameters give issuers great flexibility in pricing.</p>

<h5><a class="toc-backref" href="#id8">Fee Pools</a><a class="headerlink" href="#fee-pools" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Issuers may optionally maintain a Fee Pool. The <strong>Fee Pool is a pool of BTS</strong> and an exchange rate at which the issued asset may be converted into BTS. When a user wishes to pay a network fee with the asset, the fee pool will step in to convert the asset into BTS at the rate that the issuer has specified. This means that issuers may charge a premium every time users opt to use their asset to pay network fees rather than paying them directly with BTS.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The purpose of the fee pool is <strong>to provide a convenience to users that would like to use an asset without concerning themselves with the details of acquiring BTS</strong>. Anyone may fund the fee pool, but only the issuer may specify the exchange rate. This exchange rate is automatically set to the settlement price if the asset is collateralized by BTS.</p>

<p>If the assets fee pool is funded, the fees can be payed in the native UIA instead of BTS.</p>

<p><strong>Strategies</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>CCD / Coin Days Destroyed</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The economic effect of this vesting policy is to require a certain amount of “interest” to accrue before the full balance may be withdrawn. Interest accrues as coindays (balance * length held). If some of the balance is withdrawn, the remaining balance must be held longer.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><strong>Linear Vesting with Cliff</strong></li>

<p>Both can be defined in the Permissions tab of your account using so called <em>authorities</em> together with a so called <em>threshold</em> that has to be exceeded in order for a transaction to be valid.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Authorities</strong> :In BitShares an authority consists of one or many entities that authorize an action, such as transfers or trades.<ul>
<li>An authority consists of one or several pairs of an account name with a weight.</li>
<li>In order to obtain a valid transaction, the sum of the weights from signing the parties has to exceed the threshold as defined in the permissions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Hierarchical Corporate Accounts</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>BitShares designs permissions around people, rather than around cryptography, making it easy to use. Every account can be controlled by any weighted combination of other accounts and private keys. This creates a hierarchical structure that reflects how permissions are organized in real life, and makes multi-user control over funds easier than ever. Multi-user control is the single biggest contributor to security, and, when used properly, it can virtually eliminate the risk of theft due to hacking.</p>

<p>In BitShares an <em>authority</em> consists of one or many entities that authorize an action, such as transfers or trades.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An authority consists of one or several pairs of an account name with a <em>weight</em>.</li>
<li>In order to obtain a valid transaction, the sum of the weights from signing the parties has to exceed the threshold as defined in the permissions.</li>
</ul>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Examples</strong></dt>
<dd>We explain some examples to shed some light on the used terminology and the use-cases. We assume that a  new account is created with it’s active permissions set as described below. <strong>Note</strong> that the same scheme also works for the owner permissions.</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="flat-multi-signature">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id3">(Flat) Multi-Signature</a><a class="headerlink" href="#flat-multi-signature" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A flat multi-signature scheme is composed of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">M</span></code> entities of which <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">N</span></code> entities must sign in order for the transaction to be valid. Now, in BitShares, we have <em>weights</em> and a <em>threshold</em> instead of <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">M</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">N</span></code>. Still we can achieve the very same thing with even more flexibility as we will see now.</p>
<p>Let’s assume, Alice, Bob, Charlie and Dennis have common funds. We want to be able to construct a valid transaction if only two of those agree. Hence a <strong>2-of-4</strong> (N-of-M) scheme can look as follows:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="67%" />
<col width="33%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head">Account</th>
<th class="head">Weight</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td>Alice</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Bob</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Charlie</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Dennis</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>Threshold:</strong></td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>This means that each party has the same weight of 1 while 3 parties need to sign the transaction/proposal.</p>
<p>In other words: Alice, Bobe, Charlie and Dennis, each have 33% weight while 100% must be reached.</p>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/Multi-Signature.png"><img alt="Multi Signature" class="align-center" src="_images/Multi-Signature.png" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
<p>All four participants have a weight of 33% but the threshold is set to 51%. Hence only two out of the four need to agree to validate the transaction.</p>
<p>Alternatively, to construct a 3-of-4 scheme, we can either decrease the weights to 17 or increase the threshold to 99%.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="flat-flexible-multi-signature">
<h4><a class="toc-backref" href="#id4">(Flat) Flexible Multi-Signature</a><a class="headerlink" href="#flat-flexible-multi-signature" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>With the threshold and weights, we now have more flexibility over our funds, or more precisely, we have more <em>control</em>. For instance, we can have separate weights for different people. Let’s assume Alice wants to secure here funds against theft by a multi-signature scheme but she does not want to hand over too much control to her friends. Hence, we create an authority similar to:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="67%" />
<col width="33%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head">Account</th>
<th class="head">Weight</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td>Alice</td>
<td>49%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Bob</td>
<td>25%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Charlie</td>
<td>25%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Dennis</td>
<td>10%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>Threshold:</strong></td>
<td>51%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/Flexible-Multi-Signature.png"><img alt="Flexible Multi-Signature" class="align-center" src="_images/Flexible-Multi-Signature.png" style="width: 400px;" /></a>
<p>Now the funds can either be accessed by Alice and a single friend or by all three friends together.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at a simple multi-hierarchical corporate account setup.  We are looking at a company that has a Chief of Financial Officer (CFO) and a some departments working for him, such as the Treasurer, Controller, Tax Manager, Accounting, etc. The company also has a CEO that wants to have spending privileges. Hence we construct an authority for the funds according to:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="69%" />
<col width="31%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head">Account</th>
<th class="head">Weight</th>

</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td>CEO.COMPANY</td>
<td>51%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>CFO.COMPANY</td>
<td>51%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><strong>Threshold:</strong></td>
<td>51%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>whereas CEO.COMPANY and CFO.COMPANY have their own authorities. For instance, the CFO.COMPANY account could look like:</p>
<table border="1" class="docutils">
<colgroup>
<col width="76%" />
<col width="24%" />
</colgroup>
<thead valign="bottom">
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head">CFO.COMPANY</th>
<th class="head">Weight</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody valign="top">
<tr class="row-even"><td>Chief.COMPANY</td>
<td>51%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Treasurer.COMPANY</td>
<td>33%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Controller.COMPANY</td>
<td>33%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td>Tax Manager.COMPANY</td>
<td>10%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td>Accounting.COMPANY</td>
<td>10%</td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><strong>Threshold:</strong></td>
<td>51%</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/cfo-Multi-Hierarchical_Flexible-Multi-Signature.png"><img alt="CFO Multi-Hierarchical Flexible-Multi-Signature" class="align-center" src="_images/cfo-Multi-Hierarchical_Flexible-Multi-Signature.png" style="width: 870px;" /></a>
<p>This scheme allows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the CEO to spend funds</li>
<li>the Chief of Finance Officer to spend funds</li>
<li>Treasurer together with Controller to spend funds</li>
<li>Controller or Treasurer together with wither the Tax Manager or Accounting to
spend funds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, a try of arbitrary depth can be spanned in order to construct a flexible authority to reflect mostly any business use-case.</p>

<p>Since voting might be a too time-consuming task for many BTS Holders, BitShares offers them a way to committee their voting power to so called <strong>proxies</strong>. The sole purpose of proxies is to follow the ecosystem and be vote according to their <em>followers</em>. This is similar to many political votes where citizens vote for representatives which vote on their behalf.</p>
<p>Voting itself is <strong>very simple</strong> with the User interface and requires only a few clicks.</p>

<p>In this section, we want to describe Terminologies  and guide you to create and register your BitShares Account.</p>
<p><strong>Wallet</strong></p>
<p>Wallets interacts with the blockchain to process accounts and funds functionalities. Users register to create a single wallet. The single wallet can carry many accounts. Users who have a lifetime membership (LTM) can register multiple accounts in parallel; all of them are stored in a single wallet. Also, users can create multiple wallets to organize their accounts properly.</p>
<p><strong>Accounts</strong></p>
<p>In BitShares, you can create own <strong>unique account name</strong>, so, you can remember easily. And you will use the account name to communicate (e.g. Send fund) with other BitShares account users (BTS Holders) like an email address. The advantage of using account name is that people can identify you by using a readable and memorable word instead of cryptographic addresses.</p>
<p>Each user has at least one account that can be used to interact with the blockchain. The account can be seen as a single banking account with an individual balance, transaction history, etc. Since these accounts are registered on the blockchain and are open to the public, we recommend to pick a pseudonym to achieve some privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Keys</strong></p>
<p>Keys refer to the cryptography used to secure access to your account and funds. It is of importance to prevent others from gaining access to these keys.</p>
<p>BitShares has <em>owner, active and memo keys</em>. And each key has <em>public key and private key</em>. It’s important to know that Owner permission has administrative powers over the whole account. Active Permission is considered as an “online” permission that allows to access funds and some account settings.</p>

<p>The Graphene technology allows users to <em>propose</em> a transaction on the blockchain which requires approval of multiple accounts in order to execute.</p>
<p>At any time, a proposal can be approved in a single transaction if sufficient signatures are available (see <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">proposal_update_operation</span></code> as constructed by the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">approve_proposal</span></code> call), as long as the authority tree to approve the proposal does not exceed the maximum recursion depth. In practice, however, it
is easier to use proposals to acquire all approvals, as this leverages on-chain notification of all relevant parties that their approval is required. Off-chain multi-signature approval requires some off-chain mechanism for acquiring several signatures on a single transaction.  This off-chain synchronization can be avoided using proposals.</p>
<p>The user proposes a transaction, then signatory accounts use add or remove their approvals from this operation. When a sufficient number of approvals have been granted, the operations in the proposal are evaluated. Even if the transaction fails, the proposal will be kept until the expiration time, at which point, if sufficient approval is granted, the transaction will be evaluated a final time.
This allows transactions which will not execute successfully until a given time to still be executed through the proposal mechanism. The first time the proposed transaction succeeds, the proposal will be regarded as resolved, and all future updates will be invalid.</p>
<p>The proposal system allows for arbitrarily complex or recursively nested authorities. If a recursive authority (i.e. an authority which requires approval of ‘nested’ authorities on other accounts) is required for a proposal, then a second proposal can be used to grant the nested authority’s approval. That is, a second proposal can be created which, when sufficiently approved, adds the approval of a nested authority to the first proposal. This multiple-proposal scheme can be used to acquire approval for an arbitrarily deep authority tree.</p>

<h2>Bridge and Gateway<a class="headerlink" href="#bridge-and-gateway" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<h3>Bridge and gateway services<a class="headerlink" href="#bridge-and-gateway-services" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Both bridges and gateways allow you to deposit and withdraw coins, but there is a difference in the amount of trust you need to place in the service providers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bridges-trust-free-model">
<h3>Bridges: trust-free model<a class="headerlink" href="#bridges-trust-free-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A bridge service provides a way to deposit an amount of a crypto-currency other than BitShares, and in turn receive a SmartCoin equivalent. SmartCoins have no counterparty risk, so the only risk you experience when using a bridge is during the short time it takes to complete the transfer. This is better than a centralized exchange such as Poloniex, where you are always at risk of the exchange being hacked, going bankrupt, or experiencing any number of other issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="gateways-trust-based-model">
<h3>Gateways: trust-based model<a class="headerlink" href="#gateways-trust-based-model" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Gateways are basically equivalent to the standard exchange model where you depend on the solvency of the exchange to be able to redeem your coins. Generally gateways issue assets prefixed with their symbol, like OPEN, TRADE, or META. These assets are backed 100% by the real BTC or ETH or any other coin that people deposit with the gateways.</p>
<p>An OPEN.BTC is thus in theory equivalent to the BTC you get on Poloniex, which could be prefixed POLO.BTC. In both cases you rely on the service provider, CCEDK for OPEN. assets and Poloniex for POLO. assets, to remain solvent in order to back the value of the assets they’ve issued. Because gateways only provide this one service which is normally only one part of running an exchange, one might even argue that they have an easier job of securing their holdings.</p>

<p>BitShares accounts work differently from Bitcoin wallets in that a named account must be registered on the BitShares blockchain.  The account will declare one or more public keys to act as “authorities” capable of signing transactions.</p>
<p>BitShares accounts are very capable and flexible.  The platform supports over 40 operation types.  The most commonly used operations center around trading on the decentralized exchange (DEX), and of course simple transfers of tokens.  The BitShares “Reference” UI wallet (web wallet: <a class="reference external" href="https://wallet.bitshares.org">https://wallet.bitshares.org</a>; standalone wallet: <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-ui/releases">https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-ui/releases</a>) supports the full functionality of a BitShares account.  By contrast, the Ledger Nano BitShares app is primarily geared towards simple transfers and holding of tokens, although it is technically capable of signing any operation type.</p>
<p>This tutorial assumes that you already have an existing BitShares account for use in a standard, full-featured BitShares UI, and that you will be creating a new, separate account, to hold tokens secured by your Ledger Nano S hardware wallet device.  Essentially, we assume your existing account will be the “hot wallet,” and the new account will be your hardware-secured “cold wallet.”</p>
<div class="section" id="step-1-create-an-account-to-associate-with-the-nano">
<h4>Step 1: Create an account to associate with the Nano<a class="headerlink" href="#step-1-create-an-account-to-associate-with-the-nano" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If you already have a BitShares account and it has “lifetime membership” status, you can easily create a new account by selecting “Create Account” from the main drop-down menu (“Burger” menu) in the upper-right corner of the Reference UI.</p>
<p>If you do not already have a BitShares account, or if your account does not have lifetime-membership status, then you can use either the standalone wallet or one of the web-hosted wallets (e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://wallet.bitshares.org">https://wallet.bitshares.org</a>) to register the account, and a faucet will pay the registration fee for you. A tricky thing though is that most such wallets will only pay the registration fee for ONE account per wallet instance.  So if you used the standalone wallet to register your primary account, then you may wish to use the web-hosted wallet to register your new account, or vice-versa.  Or you can just load the web wallet from a different device, (or a different browser), to get back to the faucet-subsidized account registration screen.</p>

<p>Once you have created this account, you will next need to retrieve <strong>two</strong> public keys from your Ledger Nano S hardware wallet, and set them as your account’s “owner” and “active” authorities.  Once the original account keys are removed and replaced with these new keys, the account will be controlled solely by the Ledger Nano S hardware device.</p>

<div class="section" id="step-2-get-public-keys-from-the-ledger-nano">
<h4>Step 2: Get Public Keys from the Ledger Nano<a class="headerlink" href="#step-2-get-public-keys-from-the-ledger-nano" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A BitShares account specifies two types of authorities: “Owner,” and “Active,” which each declare a weighted list of public keys needed to sign transactions. (The weights allow for multi-signature arrangements.  Here we will only consider a single key per authority.)  For the majority of transaction types, either the “owner” authority or the “active” authority may sign the transaction.  Your newly-created account will have had default keys generated for it during registration.  We will replace these keys with public keys retrieved from the Ledger Nano device.  We do this as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Start up the companion app, <em>SimpleGUIWallet</em>.</li>
<li>Connect your Ledger Nano S hardware wallet device, unlock with PIN code, and start the BitShares app.<ul>
<li>The Nano should display the BitShares logo and the words <strong>Use wallet to view accounts</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In the companion app, select the “Public Keys” tab from the main tab array.<ul>
<li>The window will show list boxes of <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/satoshilabs/slips/blob/master/slip-0048.md">SLIP-0048</a> derivation paths for three different “roles”: Owner role, Active role, and Memo role.</li>
<li>(Note: SLIP-0048 is a key derivation scheme analogous to Bitcoin’s BIP-44, but tailored for the key roles used in Graphene-based blockchains such as BitShares.)</li>
<li>Each path will not yet show a public key, but instead will show “(??)”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click the “Query Addresses” button to retrieve the public keys corresponding to each derivation path from the Nano device.<ul>
<li>The list boxes will now be populated with paths and public keys.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<h4>Step 3: Confirm keys on Ledger Nano device<a class="headerlink" href="#step-3-confirm-keys-on-ledger-nano-device" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>It is highly recommended to <em>confirm</em> your selected keys on the Ledger Nano device prior to importing them as authorities into your new BitShares account.  This is to ensure that the <em>SimpleGUIWallet</em> companion app has not been tampered with to give you a decoy key.  Confirm keys as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>In the “Public Keys” tab of <em>SimpleGUIWallet</em>, query addresses as in the subsection above.  Then select the key you wish to confirm from the list, and click the “Confirm Address” button.</li>
<li>On your Ledger Nano device, look to see that the device says “<strong>Confirm public key</strong>” and displays the exact same public key as you see in the <em>SimpleGUIWallet</em> app.  If the keys do not match, DO NOT trust the key from <em>SimpleGUIWallet</em>.  If the keys do match, then you know that the Ledger Nano device can sign transactions using the key, and you may import the key into your account, as described in the next subsection.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="step-4-add-the-keys-to-your-new-account">
<h4>Step 4: Add the keys to your new account<a class="headerlink" href="#step-4-add-the-keys-to-your-new-account" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In the BitShares UI wallet where you created your new account, navigate to the “Permissions” area by clicking the Menu icon (upper right), selecting “Settings,” then “Accounts,” and then “View Keys” for the appropriate account, as illustrated below:</p>
<div class="align-center figure" id="id5">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/Update_Keys_UI_Location.png"><img alt="Select &quot;Settings&quot; from main menu" src="_images/Update_Keys_UI_Location.png" style="width: 90%;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Keys are managed under Settings —&gt; Accounts —&gt; View Keys.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Once in the “Permissions” tab, you should see the screen below, where we will first replace the Active authority key, and then the Owner authority key.</p>
<div class="align-center figure" id="id6">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/Update_Keys_Step3.png"><img alt="Add new key, remove old key" src="_images/Update_Keys_Step3.png" style="width: 90%;" /></a>
<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Adding a new Active key and removing the old one.</span></p>
</div>
<p>Steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Select the “Active Permissions” sub-tab, (if not already selected).</li>
<li>Observe the “Threshold” value.  If this is a new account, registered in the standard way, this value should be “1”.  Do not change it.</li>
<li>In the “Enter account name/key and weight” field, paste an appropriate key copied from the “Public Keys” tab in <em>SimpleGUIWallet</em>.  (E.g. a key from the “Active role” list, if this is for the account’s active authority.)</li>
<li>For the key weight, enter “1”.  (This is equal to the threshold, meaning this key can unilaterally sign transactions as the account’s active authority.)</li>
<li>Click “Add” to add the key to the list of keys recognized by the account.  You will now see two keys listed under “Account / Key / Addresses”.  They are the new key just added, and the old key that was generated when the account was registered.</li>
<li>Click the “Remove” button next to the old key.  This will remove the ability of the old key to sign transactions for the account, leaving only the key derived from the Ledger Nano device to sign as the account’s active authority.</li>
<li>At the top of the window, click the “Save” button to apply these changes to the account.  You will be asked to confirm the “account update” transaction, and may be asked to type the password you chose when you created the account, in order to unlock the UI wallet.  When the transaction is broadcast and confirmed on the blockchain, your account’s Active authority will have been successfully replaced with the new key managed by the Nano.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once these steps are complete, repeat the above steps, but this time for the “Owner Permissions” tab, and select a Nano key from the “Owner role” list box.</p>
<p>When both the Active and Owner keys have been replaced, your new account can <em>ONLY</em> sign transactions with the aid of your Ledger Nano hardware device, and your account is now secured.</p>
<p>(Note: The BitShares UI wallet Permissions tab will also let you replace the Memo key. However, this is not recommended in this tutorial.  Although SLIP-0048 does define a key path for memo keys, and these public keys can be retrieved from the Nano, the Ledger Nano S BitShares app does not currently support encrypting or decrypting memos with the Nano.  Leaving this key unchanged means you can still use the regular BitShares UI wallet to read memos attached to transactions.)</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id12">Using the Companion app with Nano BitShares app</a><a class="headerlink" href="#using-the-companion-app-with-nano-bitshares-app" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><em>SimpleGUIWallet</em> is a very bare-bones, rudimentary GUI interface to the Ledger Nano BitShares app. It does not maintain a database of keys or accounts, and will not write any data or configuration files to disk. When you start <em>SimpleGUIWallet</em>, you will need to tell it which BitShares account you wish to use, and which key (specified as a SLIP-0048 derivation path) to use when signing transactions.</p>
<p>The <em>SimpleGUIWallet</em> window is divided into four general areas:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Top</strong>: This is where you type the name of a BitShares account that you wish to act as, and which key will be used to sign transactions.</li>
<li><strong>Middle Left</strong>:  Here there are two tabs that show information about the selected account.  After clicking “Refresh Balances,” the Assets tab will populate with a list of assets (tokens) held by the account, and the History tab will populate with a list of recent transactions conducted by the account.</li>
<li><strong>Middle Right</strong>:  Here are tabs where you can “do things.”  There is a tab for transferring tokens, a tab for querying the Ledger Nano to determine what keys it manages, and a tab for Raw Transactions, which can be used for advanced purposes not covered by this tutorial.</li>
<li><strong>Bottom</strong>:  At the bottom is a status pane that will print messages informing you of how the app is interacting with the BitShares network and with the Ledger Nano hardware device.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you start up <em>SimpleGUIWallet</em>, it will automatically connect to the BitShares network by locating a public API node to communicate with.</p>

<div class="section" id="viewing-account-balances">
<h4>Viewing account balances<a class="headerlink" href="#viewing-account-balances" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>BitShares is a multi-asset platform.  The core token on BitShares is the BTS token, but there are also numerous user-issued assets and assets defined by smart contracts.  The Ledger Nano S BitShares app can send and receive any tokens that your BitShares account can hold.</p>
<p>The “Assets” tab on the left side of the window shows a list of assets held by the selected account, and their respective balances.  After typing a BitShares account name in the “BitShares User Account” field at the top of the window, click the “Refresh Balances” button to refresh this list.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="receiving-tokens">
<h4>Receiving tokens<a class="headerlink" href="#receiving-tokens" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Receiving crypto assets is very easy in BitShares.  Just give the sending party your BitShares account name, and they can send tokens to you.  There is no need to retrieve “addresses” or keys from the wallet in order to receive funds.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sending-tokens">
<h4>Sending tokens<a class="headerlink" href="#sending-tokens" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Sending tokens from your account can be done on the “Transfers” tab.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Enter your account name in the “BitShares User Account” field.<ul>
<li>Optional: Click “Refresh Balances” to see asset balances for this account in the Assets tab.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select the “Transfer” tab.</li>
<li>Fill out the “Send To”, “Amount”, and “Asset” fields.<ul>
<li>The “Asset” field takes a ticker symbol for the token type that you wish to send.  See the “Assets” tab for a list of tokens in your account.</li>
<li>Tip: Clicking an asset balance in the Assets list will auto-populate the asset symbol field on the Transfer tab.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Connect your Ledger Nano and start the BitShares app.</li>
<li>Click “Send Transfer”.</li>
<li>Review transaction details on the Ledger Nano’s display screen, and approve the transaction on the device via the “check” button if the details are correct, else reject it via the “x” button.</li>
<li>If you confirmed the transaction on the device, then <em>SimpleGUIWallet</em> will receive a signature from the Nano, append it to the transaction, and broadcast it to the BitShares network.  The status pane will indicate if the transaction was successful or not.</li>
</ol>
<p>After the transaction is broadcast, the balances in the Assets tab should update.  If they do not, click “Refresh Balances” to refresh them.  Likewise, the transfer operation should appear on the “History” tab, if the transaction was successful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="advanced-usage">
<h4>Advanced usage<a class="headerlink" href="#advanced-usage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If you have followed this tutorial, then your new account is now solely controlled by keys managed by your Ledger Nano S hardware wallet device.  It is possible that you may at some point desire to use some of the other features of the BitShares platform, beyond simple transfers.  The <em>BitShares App for Ledger Nano S</em> can sign any valid BitShares transaction, provided you can send it to the device for signing.  The “Raw Transactions” tab in <em>SimpleGUIWallet</em> allows this, provided you can construct the transaction as a JSON string.  How to do this is not covered by this tutorial, but the reader is directed to consult the technical documentation for BitShares or to seek the help of the BitShares community via forums or chat rooms.</p>
